The app consists of all features that are available in google maps and also can change its style and the region. It is a user friendly app unless google maps this app can be used by people of any age.  
  
  The developemet of the app began on March and the structure of the app was finished 1 month after the developement started and the entire app was finished on May. Throughout the developement journey I had both good and bad experience. I cherished the good moments and I tried to overcome the bad moments by working hard on it. And at last I coul able to finish the project without any fault.  
    
I made this app with the knowledge that I gained from my club and seniors and also from W3schools and Youtube. When I started to build the app I had only a little knowledge thet I got from listening to the classes that my club has conducted before coming to the college and I tried myself to get more knowledge as possible so I could make myself better. From the first class itself I noted that many students has already know about these kind of stuff that I'm hearig for the first time. At first it made me sad but then I tried my best and I started to learn with YouTube and hacker Rank. At the start, I was bad at solving problems but after a few tries and coding camps, I felt I am good at programming. Then I thought of creating projects using those learned programming languages. Then I started to make a tic tac toe game. During that project, I struggled a lot but I finished the project swith help of some of my seniors and from different coding sites. And some time my college was going to reopen so I had to make arrangements for my trip. After reaching college I made friends with guys who were also into coding and they were also in the same club so it was easy for us to interract and do the assignments that were given in the club. And this project I choose to build myself because I can change anything in the app without discussing with others it gives me the freedom to add anything in the app that I want to add.
